							<!--narcissistic-->
							<h2 id="narc">Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_social.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a lack of empathy for others, and a need for excessive attention and admiration.

							</p>
								<h3>Causes</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Environment ― mismatches in parent-child relationships with excessive criticism and neglect</li>
										<li>Genetics ― inherited characteristics from past generations increase the chances of narcissistic personality disorder</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>Symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h3>
									<li>Have an exaggerated sense of self-importance</li>
									<li>Require excessive admiration</li>
									<li>Expect to be superior without any achievement<li>Exaggerate achievements and talents</li>
									<li>Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance etc</li>
									<li>Take advantage of others to get what they want</li>
									<li>Behave in an arrogant manner, coming across as conceited, boastful, and pretentious</li>
									<li>Insist on having the best of everything</li>
									<li>Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special treatment</li>
									<li>React with rage to make themselves appear superior</li>
									<li>Have difficulty controlling anger</li>
									<li>Feel moody because they fall short of perfection</li>
								<h3>how it affects their life</h3>
								<P>They may experience problems at school or work because of their arrogance.

								</P>

							<h2 id="paranoid">Paranoid Personality Disorder</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_social.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<ul>
										<li>Early childhood trauma</li>
										<li>Having close relatives with schizophrenia or delusional disorder</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>how it affects their life</h3>
								<P>They may feel very anxious whenever alone in dark or narrow places because they start to overthink, feeling that there are others surrounding them when there aren't.</P>
								<p>They are unable to trust others so it may lead to problems involving social interaction with others</p>
								<p>They may distance themselves from others because they are afraid of being betrayed by them even when there is no reason to worry.

							<h2 id="boderlines">Boderline Personality Disorder</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_social.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that impacts the way you think and feel about yourself and others, causing problems functioning in everyday life. People with borderline personality disorder tend to fear being abandoned, and may push others away when they want to have loving relationships with them.
								
							</p>
								<h3>Causes</h3>
									<ul>
										Genetics. Some studies of twins and families suggest that personality disorders may be inherited or strongly associated with other mental health disorders among family members.
										Brain abnormalities. Research has shown changes in certain areas of the brain involved in emotion such as impulsivity and aggression. In addition, certain brain chemicals that help regulate mood, such as serotonin, may not function properly.
										Stressful childhood. Many people with the disorder report being sexually abused, physically abused or neglected during childhood. Those who were separated from a parent or close caregiver when they were young, or those with unstable family relationships have reported being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well.
									</ul>
								<h3>Symptoms of Boderline Personality Disorder</h3>
									<li>An intense fear of abandonment, going to extreme measures to avoid real or imagined separation or rejection</li>
									<li>A pattern of unstable relationships, such as idealizing someone for a moment and then suddenly believing the person is the worst</li>
									<li>Rapid changes in self-identity and self-image which include shifting goals and values</li>
									<li>Periods of stress-related paranoia and loss of contact with reality</li>
									<li>Impulsive and risky behavior, such as gambling, reckless driving, spending sprees, binge eating or drug abuse</li>
									<li>Suicidal behavior or self-injury, often in response to the fear of separation or rejection</li>
									<li>Wide mood swings which include intense happiness, irritability, shame, or anxiety</li>
									<li>Ongoing feelings of emptiness</li>
									<li>Frequently losing your temper, being sarcastic or bitter, or having physical fights for no particular reason</li>
									
								<h3>how it affects their life</h3>
								<P>Borderline personality disorder can negatively affect intimate relationships, jobs, school, social activities, and self-image. They may face multiple legal issues like jail time, face conflict with family or friends, feel paranoid of others around them, or get involved in abusive relationships.
								</P>

							<!--scyzotypal-->
							<h2 id="schizo">Scyzotypal</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_social.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>People with schizotypal are people who have difficulty functioning or have experienced a great deal of distress. They tend to be loners who prefer to keep their distance from others and are uncomfortable being in relationships. They also do not show much emotion even during happy and depressing times.
							</p>
								<h3>Causes</h3>
									<p>Neglect, abuse, trauma, or family dysfunction during childhood increase the risk of developing schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder can also be caused by genetics, with the chances of having it being much higher in relatives with schizophrenia than relatives with other mental illnesses or none at all.</p>
								<h3>Symptoms of Boderline Personality Disorder</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Feeling that external events have an unusual personal meaning</li>
									<li>Unusual thinking, beliefs, perceptions, or behaviour</li>
									<li>Odd speech</li>
									<li>Suspicious or paranoid ideas</li>
									<li>Bland, strange, or flat emotional responses</li>
									<li>Lack of close friends outside family</li>
									<li>Excessive, persistent social anxiety</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>how it affects their life</h3>
								<P>People with schizotypal personality disorder may feel distanced from others around them because of their odd behaviours being generally disliked by the public. They may feel insecure about their disorder and avoid creeping others out by not interacting with them at all. Many people with this disorder have an episode of major depression at some point in their lives. The stress they feel can also make things worse for them.
