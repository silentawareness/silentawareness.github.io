							<h1>Anxiety Disorders</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_aurane4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Feeling anxious is a common emotion. Some anxiety is normal when faced with stressful events. 
								However, when anxiety becomes <b>persistent, overwhelming, and irrational</b>, it may interfere with daily activities like performance at work and relationships. 
								When <b>anxiety becomes excessive</b>, one may develop an anxiety disorder.</p>
 
								<p>There are different types of anxiety disorders, including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><a href="#OCD">OCD</a></li>
										<li><a href="#panic">Panic Disorder</a></li>
										<li><a href="#phobia">Phobia</a></li>
										<li><a href="#social">Social Anxiety</a></li>
										<li><a href="#general">Generalised Anxiety Disorder</a></li>
									</ul>
								<p><b>General symptoms</b> of anxiety disorder include:</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/anxiety_symtoms.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<blockquote>Women are 60% more likely to get anxiety disorder than men
									<br>
									Panic disorder is twice as likely in women than in men, this doesn't mean men can't have panic disorder as well. It won't make a men less "manly" having mental illness or "childish"
									<br></blockquote>
									<blockquote>Anxiety disorders are mental conditions that involve excessive worrying or stress about specific situations or aspects of a person's life
								</blockquote>
							<h2 id="OCD">OCD</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_ariel.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<ul>
									<li>It causes you to obsessively repeat constant sensations or thoughts or the urge to do something over and over again</li>
									<li>It is compulsion &/or obsessions like thoughts, urges or mental images causing anxiety. However, not all habits are obsessions. </li>
									<li>A person with ocd generally cannot control their thoughts/behaviours that are recognised to be excessive</li>
									<li>Some individuals with ocd also have a tic disorder ( sudden , brief, repetitive movements )</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>causes</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Compulsions are learned behaviours, which become repetitive and habitual when they are associated with relief from anxiety. </li>
									<li>OCD is due to genetic and hereditary factors. </li>
									<li>Chemical, structural and functional abnormalities in the brain are the cause.</li>
									<li>Distorted beliefs reinforce and maintain symptoms associated with OCD.</li>
								</ul>
							<H3>Symptoms</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched</li>
									<li>Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove</li>
									<li>Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way</li>
									<li>Images of driving your car into a crowd of people</li>
									<li>Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public</li>
									<li>Unpleasant sexual images</li>
									<li>Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>How it affects their life</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>People may spend the day carrying out compulsions which would cause them to be unable to leave the house</li>
									<li>Some other people with OCD may also carry out their compulsions in secret or avoid social situations so they can carry out their compulsions fully</li>
								</ul>
								<blockquote>OCD affects both men and women equally
									<br>
									Other disorders may exist along with OCD such as <a href="anxiety.html">anxiety disoders</a>, <a href="eating.html">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tourette-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350465#:~:text=Tourette%20(too%2DRET)%20syndrome,unusual%20sounds%20or%20offensive%20words.">tourette syndrome</a>, <a href="stress.html">depression</a> and more :) 
								</blockquote>
							<h2 id="panic">Panic Disorder</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_aurane1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A panic attack is a <b>sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions</b> when there is no real danger or apparent cause. When panic attacks occur, you might think <b>you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.</b></p>

								<p>Many people have just <b>one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes</b>, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had <b>recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack</b>, you <b>may</b> have a condition called panic disorder.</p>
								<p>Panic disorder is characterized by <b> persistent fear of having another panic attack</b> after you have experienced at least one month (or more) of persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks (or their consequences) recurring. You may be having a panic attack when you feel the sudden, overwhelming terror that has no obvious cause. </p>

								<p>Although panic attacks themselves<b> aren't life-threatening</b>, they can be <b>frightening and significantly affect your quality of life</b>. Even though the symptoms of this disorder can be quite overwhelming and frightening, they can be <b>managed and improved with treatment</b>. Seeking treatment is the most important part of reducing symptoms and improving your quality of life.</P>
									
								<h3>Causes</h3>
									<p>The causes of panic disorder are not clearly understood. Research has shown that panic disorder may be genetically linked. Panic disorder is also associated with significant transitions that occur in life. </p>
								<h3>Who is at risk for developing a panic disorder?</h3>
									<p>Information about the disease does indicate that certain groups are more likely to develop the disorder. In particular, women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
								<!--<h3>Treatment</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>maintaining a regular schedule</li>
										<li>exercising on a regular basis</li>
										<li>getting enough sleep</li>
										<li>avoiding the use of stimulants such as caffeine</li>
									</ul>-->
								<h3>Symptoms</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/panic_symptoms.png" alt="" /></span>
								<blockquote>In general, panic disorder is characterized by recurring, unexpected panic attacks.
								<br><br>
								They often happen without warning and result in physical symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, shaking, and dizziness. They also may involve feeling dissociated from reality or having a sense of impending doom.
								<br><br>
								Normally, an attack lasts less than 20 minutes.</blockquote>
							<h3>how it affects their life</h3>
								<p>Panic disorder can interfere a lot with daily life, causing people to miss work, go to many doctor visits, and avoid situations where they fear they might experience a panic attack. </p>

							<h2 id="social">Social Anxiety</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_social.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Social anxiety disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that causes <b>extreme fear in social settings</b>. People with this disorder have trouble talking to people, meeting new people, and attending social gatherings. They <b>fear being judged or scrutinized</b> by others. They may understand that their fears are irrational or unreasonable, but <b>feel powerless</b> to overcome them.</p>
								<p>Some people with the disorder do not have anxiety in social situations but have <b>performance anxiety</b> instead.</p> 
								
								<h3>Causes</h3>
									<p>The exact cause of the social phobia is unknown. However, current research supports the idea that it is caused by a combination of environmental factors and genetics. Negative experiences may also contribute to the disorder, which includes:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>bullying</li>
										<li>family conflict</li>
										<li>sexual abuse</li>
									</ul>
									<p>If you have a family member with social phobia, you’re more at risk of having it, too. </p>
								<h3>Symptoms of Social Anxiety</h3>
									<p>When having to perform in front of or be around others, people with social anxiety disorder tend to:</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/social_symptoms.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Psychological symptoms may include:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>worrying intensely about social situations</li>
										<li>worrying for days or weeks before an event</li>
										<li>avoiding social situations or trying to blend into the background if you must attend</li>
										<li>worrying about embarrassing yourself in a social situation</li>
										<li>worrying that other people will notice you are stressed or nervous</li>
										<li>missing school or work because of anxiety</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>how it affects their life</h3>
								<P>Social anxiety disorder prevents you from living your life. You'll avoid situations that most people consider “normal.” You might even have a hard time understanding how others can handle them so easily. When you avoid all or most social situations, it affects your personal relationships</P>
							<blockquote>Approximately 40% of social phobias appear before the age of ten, and 95% before the age of twenty. 
								<br>
								Social Phobia is also associated with fear of performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. 
								<br>
								<b>Social Phobia is not shyness.</b></blockquote>
							<h2 id="general">Generalised Anxiety Disorder ( GAD )</h2>	
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_aurane5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>GAD is different from normal feelings of anxiousness. It’s common to feel anxious about the things happening in your life — such as your upcoming exams— every once in a while. A person who has GAD may <b>worry uncontrollably</b> about their studies several times per day for months on end. This can happen even when<b> there isn’t a reason to worry</b>. The person is often aware that there is no reason for them to worry.</p>
								<p>Sometimes people with this condition <b>just worry, but they are unable to say what they are worried about</b>. They report feelings that something bad may happen or may report that they <b>can’t calm themselves</b>.</p>
								This excessive, unrealistic worry can be frightening and can interfere with relationships and daily activities.
									<blockquote>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things. People with GAD may anticipate disaster and may be overly concerned about money, health, family, work, or other issues.</blockquote>
									
									<h3>Causes and risk factors</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>a family history of anxiety</li>
										<li>recent or prolonged exposure to stressful situations, including personal or family illnesses</li>
										<li>excessive use of caffeine or tobacco, which can make existing anxiety worse</li>
										<li>childhood abuse</li>
										<li>According to the Mayo Clinic, women are twice as likely as men to experience GAD.</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>Symptoms</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/gad_symptoms.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>how it affects their life</h3>
								<p>Anxiety can disrupt a person's life by impacting their relationships with others, self-confidence and ability to complete daily tasks at work or school.</p>
