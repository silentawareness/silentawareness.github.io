							<h1>Anxiety Disorders</h1>
							<p>Feeling anxious is a common emotion. Some anxiety is normal when faced with stressful events. 
								However, when anxiety becomes <b>persistent, overwhelming, and irrational</b>, it may interfere with daily activities like performance at work and relationships. 
								When <b>anxiety becomes excessive</b>, one may develop an anxiety disorder.</p>
 
								<p>There are different types of anxiety disorders, including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><a href="#OCD">OCD</a></li>
										<li><a href="#panic">Panic Disorder</a></li>
										<li><a href="#phobia">Phobia</a></li>
										<li><a href="#social">Social Anxiety</a></li>
										<li><a href="#general">Generalised Anxiety Disorder</a></li>
									</ul>
								<p><b>General symptoms</b> of anxiety disorder include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Chest pain // discomfort</li>
										​<li>Cold, numb // tingly hands and feet</li>
										<li>Difficulties remaining calm and staying still</li>
										<li>Dizziness</li>
										<li>Excessive fear and worrying</li>
										<li>Heart palpitations</li>
										<li>Shortness of breath</li>
										<li>Sweating</li>
										<li>Restlessness</li>
										<li>panic</li>
										<li>irritability</li>
										<li>irrational fear of danger</li>
										<li>racing thoughts</li>
										<li>shortness of breath or rapid breathing</li>
										<li>sleep issues</li>
									</ul>
							<h2 id="OCD">OCD</h2>
							<h3>What is OCD?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>It causes you to obsessively repeat constant sensations or thoughts or the urge to do something over and over again</li>
									<li>It is compulsion &/or obsessions like thoughts, urges or mental images causing anxiety. However, not all habits are obsessions. </li>

									<li>A person with ocd generally cannot control their thoughts/behaviours that are recognised to be excessive</li>
									<li>Some individuals with ocd also have a tic disorder ( sudden , brief, repetitive movements )</li>
								</ul>
							<H3>Symptoms of OCD</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched</li>
									<li>Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove</li>
									<li>Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way</li>
									<li>Images of driving your car into a crowd of people</li>
									<li>Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public</li>
									<li>Unpleasant sexual images</li>
									<li>Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>How will OCD affect your daily life?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>People may spend the day carrying out compulsions which would cause them to be unable to leave the house</li>
									<li>Some other people with OCD may also carry out their compulsions in secret or avoid social situations so they can carry out their compulsions fully</li>
								</ul>
							<h2 id="panic">Panic Disorder</h2>
								<p>A panic attack is a <b>sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions</b> when there is no real danger or apparent cause. When panic attacks occur, you might think <b>you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.</b></p>

								<p>Many people have just <b>one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes</b>, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had <b>recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack</b>, you <b>may</b> have a condition called panic disorder.</p>
								<p>Panic disorder is characterized by <b> persistent fear of having another panic attack</b> after you have experienced at least one month (or more) of persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks (or their consequences) recurring. You may be having a panic attack when you feel the sudden, overwhelming terror that has no obvious cause. </p>

								<p>Although panic attacks themselves<b> aren't life-threatening</b>, they can be <b>frightening and significantly affect your quality of life</b>. Even though the symptoms of this disorder can be quite overwhelming and frightening, they can be <b>managed and improved with treatment</b>. Seeking treatment is the most important part of reducing symptoms and improving your quality of life.</P>

								<h3>What causes panic disorder?</h3>
									<p>The causes of panic disorder are not clearly understood. Research has shown that panic disorder may be genetically linked. Panic disorder is also associated with significant transitions that occur in life. </p>
								<h3>Who is at risk for developing a panic disorder?</h3>
									<p>Information about the disease does indicate that certain groups are more likely to develop the disorder. In particular, women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
								<h3> What can I do about it?</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>maintaining a regular schedule</li>
										<li>exercising on a regular basis</li>
										<li>getting enough sleep</li>
										<li>avoiding the use of stimulants such as caffeine</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>What is the long-term outlook?</h3>
									<p>Panic disorder is often a chronic (long-term) condition that can be difficult to treat. Some people with this disorder do not respond well to treatment. Others may have periods when they have no symptoms and periods when their symptoms are quite intense. Most people with panic disorder will experience some symptom relief through treatment.<p>
								<h3>How can panic disorder be prevented?</h3>
									<p>It may not be possible to prevent panic disorder. However, you can work to reduce your symptoms by avoiding alcohol and stimulants such as caffeine as well as illicit drugs. It is also helpful to notice if you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety following a distressing life event. If you are bothered by something that you experienced or were exposed to, discuss the situation with your primary care provider.</p>
								<h3>Symptoms</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Fear of losing control and/ or dying</li>
										<li>Maladaptive change in behaviour to avoid having panic attacks</li>
										<li>Persistent concern // worry about future panic attacks and their consequences</li>
										<li>Sense of impending doom or danger</li>
										<li>Fear of loss of control or death</li>
										<li>Rapid, pounding heart rate</li>
										<li>Sweating</li>
										<li>Trembling or shaking</li>
										<li>Shortness of breath or tightness in your throat</li>
										<li>Chills</li>
										<li>Nausea</li>
										<li>Abdominal cramping</li>
										<li>Chest pain</li>
										<li>Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness</li>
										<li>Numbness or tingling sensation</li>
										<li>Feeling of unreality or detachment</li>
									</ul>
								<blockquote>In general, panic disorder is characterized by recurring, unexpected panic attacks.
								<br><br>
								They often happen without warning and result in physical symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, shaking, and dizziness. They also may involve feeling dissociated from reality or having a sense of impending doom.
								<br><br>
								Normally, an attack lasts less than 20 minutes.</blockquote>

							<h2 id="social">Social Anxiety</h2>
							<p>Social anxiety disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that causes <b>extreme fear in social settings</b>. People with this disorder have trouble talking to people, meeting new people, and attending social gatherings. They <b>fear being judged or scrutinized</b> by others. They may understand that their fears are irrational or unreasonable, but <b>feel powerless</b> to overcome them.</p>
								<p>Some people with the disorder do not have anxiety in social situations but have <b>performance anxiety</b> instead.</p> 
								<h3>Symptoms of Social Anxiety<h3>
									<p>When having to perform in front of or be around others, people with social anxiety disorder tend to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Blush, sweat, tremble, feel a rapid heart rate, or feel their “mind going blank”</li>
										<li>Feel nauseous or sick to their stomach</li>
										<li>Show a rigid body posture, make little eye contact, or speak with an overly soft voice</li>
										<li>Find it scary and difficult to be with other people, especially those they don’t already know and have a hard time talking to them</li>
										<li>Be very self-conscious in front of other people and feel embarrassed and awkward</li>
										<li>Be very afraid that other people will judge them</li>
										<li>Stay away from places where there are other people</li>
									</ul>
								<h4>Psychological symptoms may include:<h4>
									<ul>
										<li>worrying intensely about social situations</li>
										<li>worrying for days or weeks before an event</li>
										<li>avoiding social situations or trying to blend into the background if you must attend</li>
										<li>worrying about embarrassing yourself in a social situation</li>
										<li>worrying that other people will notice you are stressed or nervous</li>
										<li>missing school or work because of anxiety</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>What Causes Social Anxiety</h3>
									<p>The exact cause of the social phobia is unknown. However, current research supports the idea that it is caused by a combination of environmental factors and genetics. Negative experiences may also contribute to the disorder, which includes:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>bullying</li>
										<li>family conflict</li>
										<li>sexual abuse</li>
									</ul>
									<p>If you have a family member with social phobia, you’re more at risk of having it, too. </p>
								<h3>How is Social Anxiety Diagnosed?</h3>
									<p>There is <b>no medical test</b> to check for social anxiety disorder. Your healthcare provider will diagnose social phobia from a description of your symptoms. They can also diagnose social phobia after examining certain behavioural patterns.</p>
									<p>During your appointment, your healthcare provider will ask you to explain your symptoms. They will also ask you to talk about situations that cause your symptoms. The criteria for social anxiety disorder includes:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>constant fear of social situations due to the fear of humiliation or embarrassment</li>
										<li>feeling anxious or panicky before a social interaction</li>
										<li>the realization that your fears are unreasonable</li>
										<li>anxiety that disrupts daily life</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>How is Social Anxiety treated?</h3>
									<p>Social anxiety disorder is generally treated through psychotherapy (sometimes called “talk” therapy), medication, or both. Speak with your doctor or health care provider about the best treatment for you.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Cognitive-behavioural therapy ( Psychotherapy )</li>
										<p>This therapy helps you learn how to <b>control anxiety</b> through relaxation and breathing, and how to <b>replace negative thoughts</b> with positive ones. It can also help you to learn and practice social skills. Psychotherapy delivered in a <b>group format</b> can be especially helpful.</p>
										</li>Exposure therapy</li>
										<p>This type of therapy helps you gradually face social situations, rather than avoiding them.</p>
										<h4>At-home treatments include:<h4>
										<li>Avoiding caffeine</li>
										<p>Foods such as coffee, chocolate, and soda are stimulants and may increase anxiety.</p>
										<li>Getting plenty of sleep</li>
										<p>Getting <b>at least eight hours of sleep</b> per night is recommended. Lack of sleep can increase anxiety and worsen symptoms of social phobia.</p>
									</ol>
							<h2 id="general">Generalised Anxiety Disorder ( GAD )</h2>	
								<p>GAD is different from normal feelings of anxiousness. It’s common to feel anxious about the things happening in your life — such as your upcoming exams— every once in a while. A person who has GAD may <b>worry uncontrollably</b> about their studies several times per day for months on end. This can happen even when<b> there isn’t a reason to worry</b>. The person is often aware that there is no reason for them to worry.</p>
								<p>Sometimes people with this condition <b>just worry, but they are unable to say what they are worried about</b>. They report feelings that something bad may happen or may report that they <b>can’t calm themselves</b>.</p>
								This excessive, unrealistic worry can be frightening and can interfere with relationships and daily activities.
									<blockquote>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things. People with GAD may anticipate disaster and may be overly concerned about money, health, family, work, or other issues.</blockquote>
								<h3>What are the causes and risk factors for GAD?</h3>
								<p>Causes of and risk factors for GAD may include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>a family history of anxiety</li>
										<li>recent or prolonged exposure to stressful situations, including personal or family illnesses</li>
										<li>excessive use of caffeine or tobacco, which can make existing anxiety worse</li>
										<li>childhood abuse</li>
										<li>According to the Mayo Clinic, women are twice as likely as men to experience GAD.</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>Outlook for those with generalized anxiety disorder</h3>
									<p>Most people can manage GAD with a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned about how much you worry. They can refer you to a mental health specialist.</p>
								<h3>Symptoms</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Apprehension</li>
										<li>Confusion</li>
										<li>Shaking</li>
										<li>A sense of helplessness</li>
										<li>Pounding heart (palpitations)</li>

										<li>Neurological symptoms, such as numbness or tingling in different parts of the body</li>
										<li>Feeling muscle tension and experiencing weakness</li>
										<li>Having difficulty keeping worry levels under control</li>
										<li>Struggling with sleep, such as difficulties falling asleep or staying asleep, or not feeling well-rested</li>
