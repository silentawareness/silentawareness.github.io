							<h1>Anxiety Disorders</h1>
							<p>Feeling anxious is a common emotion. Some anxiety is normal when faced with stressful events. 
								However, when anxiety becomes <b>persistent, overwhelming, and irrational</b>, it may interfere with daily activities like performance at work and relationships. 
								When <b>anxiety becomes excessive</b>, one may develop an anxiety disorder.</p>
 
								<p>There are different types of anxiety disorders, including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><a href="#OCD">OCD</a></li>
										<li><a href="#panic">Panic Disorder</a></li>
										<li><a href="#phobia">Phobia</a></li>
										<li><a href="#social">Social Anxiety</a></li>
										<li><a href="#general">Generalised Anxiety Disorder</a></li>
									</ul>

									</ul>
							<h2 id="OCD">OCD</h2>
							<h3>What is OCD?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>It causes you to obsessively repeat constant sensations or thoughts or the urge to do something over and over again</li>
									<li>It is compulsion &/or obsessions like thoughts, urges or mental images causing anxiety. However, not all habits are obsessions. </li>

									<li>A person with ocd generally cannot control their thoughts/behaviours that are recognised to be excessive</li>
									<li>Some individuals with ocd also have a tic disorder ( sudden , brief, repetitive movements )</li>
								</ul>
							<H3>Symptoms of OCD</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched</li>
									<li>Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove</li>
									<li>Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way</li>
									<li>Images of driving your car into a crowd of people</li>
									<li>Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public</li>
									<li>Unpleasant sexual images</li>
									<li>Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>How will OCD affect your daily life?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>People may spend the day carrying out compulsions which would cause them to be unable to leave the house</li>
									<li>Some other people with OCD may also carry out their compulsions in secret or avoid social situations so they can carry out their compulsions fully</li>
								</ul>
							<h2 id="panic">Panic Disorder</h2>
							<h2> Panic disorder</h2>
								<p>A panic attack is a <b>sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions</b> when there is no real danger or apparent cause. When panic attacks occur, you might think <b>you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.</b></p>

								<p>Many people have just <b>one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes</b>, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had <b>recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack</b>, you <b>may</b> have a condition called panic disorder.</p>
								<p>Panic disorder is characterized by <b> persistent fear of having another panic attack</b> after you have experienced at least one month (or more) of persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks (or their consequences) recurring. You may be having a panic attack when you feel the sudden, overwhelming terror that has no obvious cause. </p>

								<p>Although panic attacks themselves<b> aren't life-threatening</b>, they can be <b>frightening and significantly affect your quality of life</b>. Even though the symptoms of this disorder can be quite overwhelming and frightening, they can be <b>managed and improved with treatment</b>. Seeking treatment is the most important part of reducing symptoms and improving your quality of life.</P>

								<h3>What causes panic disorder?</h3>
									<p>The causes of panic disorder are not clearly understood. Research has shown that panic disorder may be genetically linked. Panic disorder is also associated with significant transitions that occur in life. </p>
								<h3>Who is at risk for developing a panic disorder?</h3>
									<p>Information about the disease does indicate that certain groups are more likely to develop the disorder. In particular, women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
								<h3> What can I do about it?</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>maintaining a regular schedule</li>
										<li>exercising on a regular basis</li>
										<li>getting enough sleep</li>
										<li>avoiding the use of stimulants such as caffeine</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>What is the long-term outlook?<h3>
									<p>Panic disorder is often a chronic (long-term) condition that can be difficult to treat. Some people with this disorder do not respond well to treatment. Others may have periods when they have no symptoms and periods when their symptoms are quite intense. Most people with panic disorder will experience some symptom relief through treatment.<p>
								<h3>How can panic disorder be prevented?</h3>
									<p>It may not be possible to prevent panic disorder. However, you can work to reduce your symptoms by avoiding alcohol and stimulants such as caffeine as well as illicit drugs. It is also helpful to notice if you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety following a distressing life event. If you are bothered by something that you experienced or were exposed to, discuss the situation with your primary care provider.</p>
								<h3>Symptoms</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Fear of losing control and/ or dying</li>
										<li>Maladaptive change in behaviour to avoid having panic attacks</li>
										<li>Persistent concern // worry about future panic attacks and their consequences</li>
										<li>Sense of impending doom or danger</li>
										<li>Fear of loss of control or death</li>
										,<li>Rapid, pounding heart rate</li>
										<li>Sweating</li>
										<li>Trembling or shaking</li>
										<li>Shortness of breath or tightness in your throat</li>
										<li>Chills</li>
										<li>Nausea</li>
										<li>Abdominal cramping</li>
										<li>Chest pain</li>
										<li>Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness</li>
										<li>Numbness or tingling sensation</li>

									</ul>
								<blockquote>In general, panic disorder is characterized by recurring, unexpected panic attacks.
								<br><br>
								They often happen without warning and result in physical symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, shaking, and dizziness. They also may involve feeling dissociated from reality or having a sense of impending doom.
								<br><br>
								Normally, an attack lasts less than 20 minutes.</blockquote>
