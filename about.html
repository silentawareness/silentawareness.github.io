							<h2>Self-Harm</h2>
								<p>Remember, <b>self-harm isn’t a su*c*de attempt or a cry for attention</b>. Instead, it can be a way for some people to cope with overwhelming and distressing thoughts or feelings. </p>
									<blockquote>10% of young people self-harm</blockquote>
									<p><b>Self-harm should be taken seriously, whatever the reason behind it is.</b></p>
							<h3>What is self-harm?</h3>
								<p>Self-harm describes any behaviour where someone <b>causes harm to themselves</b>, usually as a way to <b>help cope with difficult or distressing thoughts and feelings</b>. 
									<br><br>
									It most frequently takes the form of <i>cutting, burning or non-lethal overdoses</i>. However, it can also be <i>any behaviour that causes injury</i> - no matter how minor, or high-risk behaviours.
									<br><br>
									Basically, any behaviour that <b>causes harm or injury</b> to someone as a way to deal with difficult emotions can be seen as self-harm.</p>
									<p><b>If you self-harm, always remember that there are a lot of people who also know what you’re going through.</b></p>
									<blockquote>Most young people reported that they started to hurt themselves around the age of 12. It’s believed that around 10-20% of young people self-harm. </blockquote>
							<h3>Why do people self-harm?</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>difficulties at home</li>
								<li>arguments or problems with friends</li>
								<li>school pressure</li>
								<li>bullying</li>
								<li>d*pr*ss*on</li>
								<li>anx**ty</li>
								<li>low self-esteem</li>
								<li>transitions and changes, such as changing schools</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h3>Signs of self-harm</h3>
								<p>If you think a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for signs, including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns - usually on the wrists, arms, thighs and chest</li>
								<li>keeping themselves fully covered at all times, even in hot weather</li>
								<li>pulling out their hair</li>
								<li>self-loathing and expressing a wish to punish themselves</li>
								<li>speaking about not wanting to go on and wishing to end it all</li>
								<li>becoming very withdrawn and not speaking to others</li>
								<li>changes in eating habits or being secretive about eating</li>
								<li>unusual weight loss or weight gain</li>
								<li>signs of low self-esteem, such as blaming themselves for any problems or thinking they're not good enough for something</li>
								<li>signs of depression, such as low moods, tearfulness or a lack of motivation or interest in anything</li>
							</ul>
