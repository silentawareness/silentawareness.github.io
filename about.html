							<h1>Mental Health</h1>
								<p>A person struggling with mental health issues may <b>neglect their physical health</b> or damage their bodies. 
								Mental health problems may lead to physical heath problems as a result of symptoms such as cu**ing yourself, punching the wall until your knuckles bleed, hitting something really hard with brute force.
								<I>Please dont make fun of people who do these, instead, talk to them or advise them to go to the school councillor. This is an actual problem and shouldn't be made fun of </I>
								<br><br>
								<b>More than 1 in 7 people</b> in Singapore have mental health issues. Su*c*de is the <b>third leading cause of d*ath among teens</b> because of the <b>stress</b> and <B>pressure they go through from everyone</B>, including themselves.

								<h3>Generalised Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) </h3>
									<p>GAD is different from normal feelings of anxiousness. It’s common to feel anxious about the things happening in your life — such as your upcoming exams— every once in a while. A person who has GAD may <b>worry uncontrollably</b> about their studies several times per day for months on end. This can happen even when<b> there isn’t a reason to worry</b>. The person is often aware that there is no reason for them to worry.</p>
									<p>Sometimes people with this condition <b>just worry, but they are unable to say what they are worried about</b>. They report feelings that something bad may happen or may report that they <b>can’t calm themselves</b>.</p>
										This excessive, unrealistic worry can be frightening and can interfere with relationships and daily activities.
								<h4>What are the causes and risk factors for GAD?</h4>
									<p>Causes of and risk factors for GAD may include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>a family history of anxiety</li>
										<li>recent or prolonged exposure to stressful situations, including personal or family illnesses</li>
										<li>excessive use of caffeine or tobacco, which can make existing anxiety worse</li>
										<li>childhood abuse</li>
										<li>According to the Mayo Clinic, women are twice as likely as men to experience GAD.</li>
									</ul>
								<h4>How is generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed?</h4>
									<p>GAD is diagnosed with a mental health screening that your primary care provider can perform. They will ask you questions about your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. They can refer you to a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.</p>
										
								<h4>How is generalized anxiety disorder treated?</h4>
									<p> Some treatments include, cognitive behavioral therapy, medication and  lifestyle changes to help ease symptoms of GAD.</p>
										
								<h4>Outlook for those with generalized anxiety disorder</h4>
									<p>Most people can manage GAD with a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned about how much you worry. They can refer you to a mental health specialist.</p>
						
										<blockquote>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things. People with GAD may anticipate disaster and may be overly concerned about money, health, family, work, or other issues.</blockquote>
								<h4>Symptoms</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Apprehension</li>
										<li>Confusion</li>
										<li>Shaking</li>
										<li>A sense of helplessness</li>
										<li>Palpitations</li>							
										<li>Feeling restless, wound up, or on edge</li>						
										<li>Being fatigue and exhausted</li>						
										<li>Struggling to concentrate</li>
										<li>Experiencing irritation</li>
										<li>Neurological symptoms, such as numbness or tingling in different parts of the body</li>

										<li>Repeated stomach aches or diarrhea</li>
										<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
										<li>Repeated negative thoughts</li>
									</ul>
										
								<h3> Panic disorder</h3>
									<p>A panic attack is a <b>sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions</b> when there is no real danger or apparent cause. When panic attacks occur, you might think <b>you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.</b></p>
									<p>Many people have just <b>one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes</b>, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had <b>recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack</b>, you <b>may</b> have a condition called panic disorder.</p>
									<p>Panic disorder is characterized by <b> persistent fear of having another panic attack</b> after you have experienced at least one month (or more) of persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks (or their consequences) recurring. You may be having a panic attack when you feel sudden, overwhelming terror that has no obvious cause. </p>
										
									<p>Although panic attacks themselves<b> aren't life-threatening</b>, they can be <b>frightening and significantly affect your quality of life</b>. Even though the symptoms of this disorder can be quite overwhelming and frightening, they can be <b>managed and improved with treatment</b>. Seeking treatment is the most important part of reducing symptoms and improving your quality of life.</P>
										
								<h4>What causes panic disorder?</h4>
									<p>The causes of panic disorder are not clearly understood. Research has shown that panic disorder may be genetically linked. Panic disorder is also associated with significant transitions that occur in life. </p>
								<h4>Who is at risk for developing panic disorder?</h4>
									<p>Information about the disease does indicate that certain groups are more likely to develop the disorder. In particular, women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
								<h4>How is panic disorder diagnosed?</h4>
									<p>If you experience symptoms of a panic attack, you may seek emergency medical care. Most people who experience a panic attack for the first time believe that they are having a heart attack.</P>
									<p>Your primary care provider may perform a mental health examination and ask you about your symptoms. All other medical disorders will be ruled out before your primary care provider makes a diagnosis of panic disorder.</p>
								<h4>How is panic disorder treated?</h4>
									<p>Treatment for panic disorder focuses on reducing or eliminating your symptoms. This is achieved through therapy with a qualified professional and in some cases, medication. Therapy typically involves cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This therapy teaches you to <b>change your thoughts and actions</b> so that you can <b>understand your attacks and manage your fear</b>.</P>
									<p>Medications used to treat panic disorder can include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a class of antidepressant. </P>
									<p>In addition to this treatments, there are a number of steps that you can take at home to reduce your symptoms. Examples include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>maintaining a regular schedule</li>
										<li>exercising on a regular basis</li>
										<li>getting enough sleep</li>
										<li>avoiding the use of stimulants such as caffeine</li>
									</ul>
								<h4>What is the long-term outlook?</h4>
									<p>Panic disorder is often a chronic (long-term) condition that can be difficult to treat. Some people with this disorder do not respond well to treatment. Others may have periods when they have no symptoms and periods when their symptoms are quite intense. Most people with panic disorder will experience some symptom relief through treatment.<p>
								<h4>How can panic disorder be prevented?</h4>
										<p>It may not be possible to prevent panic disorder. However, you can work to reduce your symptoms by avoiding alcohol and stimulants such as caffeine as well as illicit drugs. It is also helpful to notice if you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety following a distressing life event. If you are bothered by something that you experienced or were exposed to, discuss the situation with your primary care provider.</p>
								<h3>Symptoms</h3>

							<h1>Self-Harm</h1>
								<p>Remember, <b>self-harm isn’t a su*c*de attempt or a cry for attention</b>. Instead, it can be a way for some people to cope with overwhelming and distressing thoughts or feelings. </p>
									<blockquote>10% of young people self-harm</blockquote>
									<p><b>Self-harm should be taken seriously, whatever the reason behind it is.</b></p>
							<h2>What is self-harm?</h2>
								<p>Self-harm describes any behaviour where someone <b>causes harm to themselves</b>, usually as a way to <b>help cope with difficult or distressing thoughts and feelings</b>. 
									<br><br>
									It most frequently takes the form of <i>cu**ing, burning or non-lethal overdoses</i>. However, it can also be <i>any behaviour that causes injury</i> - no matter how minor, or high-risk behaviours.
									<br><br>
									Basically, any behaviour that <b>causes harm or injury</b> to someone as a way to deal with difficult emotions can be seen as self-harm.</p>
									<p><b>If you self-harm, always remember that there are a lot of people who also know what you’re going through.</b></p>
