							<h1>Mental Health</h1>
								<p>A person struggling with mental health issues may <b>neglect their physical health</b> or damage their bodies. 
								Mental health problems may lead to physical heath problems as a result of symptoms such as cu**ing yourself, punching the wall until your knuckles bleed, hitting something really hard with brute force.
								<I>Please dont make fun of people who do these, instead, talk to them or advise them to go to the school councillor. This is an actual problem and shouldn't be made fun of </I>
								<br><br>
								<b>More than 1 in 7 people</b> in Singapore have mental health issues. Su*c*de is the <b>third leading cause of d*ath among teens</b> because of the <b>stress</b> and <B>pressure they go through from everyone</B>, including themselves.
								<BR>
								Mental illness has a wide range from mild to very severe.</p> 
							<h2>Signs to look out for</h2>
								<p>Even if you have <b>5 out of 7 signs</b>, you <b>can’t self diagnose.</b> <br>
								You have to be <b>clinically diagnosed</b> by a psychiatrist.</p>
								<ul>	
									<li>Changes in sleep</li>
									<li>New onset of guilt</li>
									<li>Changes in energy level</li>
									<li>Changes in concentration or task completion</li>
									<li>Changes in appetite</li>
									<li>Changes in motivation</li>
									<li>Thoughts of su*c*de</li>
								</ul>
							<h1>Common Mental Illnesses</h1>

							<h1>Self-Harm</h1>
								<p>Remember, <b>self-harm isn’t a su*c*de attempt or a cry for attention</b>. Instead, it can be a way for some people to cope with overwhelming and distressing thoughts or feelings. </p>
									<blockquote>10% of young people self-harm</blockquote>
									<p><b>Self-harm should be taken seriously, whatever the reason behind it is.</b></p>
							<h2>What is self-harm?</h2>
								<p>Self-harm describes any behaviour where someone <b>causes harm to themselves</b>, usually as a way to <b>help cope with difficult or distressing thoughts and feelings</b>. 
									<br><br>
									It most frequently takes the form of <i>cu**ing, burning or non-lethal overdoses</i>. However, it can also be <i>any behaviour that causes injury</i> - no matter how minor, or high-risk behaviours.
									<br><br>
									Basically, any behaviour that <b>causes harm or injury</b> to someone as a way to deal with difficult emotions can be seen as self-harm.</p>
									<p><b>If you self-harm, always remember that there are a lot of people who also know what you’re going through.</b></p>
									<blockquote>Most young people reported that they started to hurt themselves around the age of 12. It’s believed that around 10-20% of young people self-harm. </blockquote>
							<h2>Why do people self-harm?</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>difficulties at home</li>
								<li>arguments or problems with friends</li>
								<li>school pressure</li>
								<li>bullying</li>
								<li>d*pr*ss*on</li>
								<li>anx**ty</li>
								<li>low self-esteem</li>
								<li>transitions and changes, such as changing schools</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2>Signs of self-harm</h2>
								<p>If you think a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for signs, including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns - usually on the wrists, arms, thighs and chest</li>
								<li>keeping themselves fully covered at all times, even in hot weather</li>
								<li>pulling out their hair</li>
								<li>self-loathing and expressing a wish to punish themselves</li>
								<li>speaking about not wanting to go on and wishing to end it all</li>
								<li>becoming very withdrawn and not speaking to others</li>
								<li>changes in eating habits or being secretive about eating</li>
								<li>unusual weight loss or weight gain</li>
								<li>signs of low self-esteem, such as blaming themselves for any problems or thinking they're not good enough for something</li>
								<li>signs of depression, such as low moods, tearfulness or a lack of motivation or interest in anything</li>
							</ul>
						
							<p>So be sure to look out for your friends and advise them to go to our school counsellor if needed.
