							<h1>Stress-related Disorder</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_shodiqin2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Stress is a normal human reaction that happens to everyone. In fact, the human body is designed to experience stress and react to it. 
								When you experience changes or challenges (stressors), your body produces physical and mental responses. That’s stress.</p>
							<p>Stress responses help your body adjust to new situations. Stress can be positive, keeping us alert, motivated and ready to avoid danger. 
								<i>For example, if you have an important test coming up, a stress response might help your body work harder and stay awake longer. </i>
								But stress becomes a problem when stressors continue without relief or periods of relaxation.</p>
 
								<p>Stress can lead to different mental illnesses</p>

								<p>Depression ( major depressive disorder ) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. It is a disorder that cause feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. Because it affects the way you think, it can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can even decrease your ability to function at work and at home.</p>

								<h3>Causes</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Family history.</li> 
										<p>You’re at a higher risk of developing depression if you have a family history of depression or another mood disorder.</p>
									<li>Early childhood trauma.</li> 
										<p>Some events affect the way your body reacts to fear and stressful situations, especially if those events occurred during childhood.</p>
									<li>Brain structure.</li> 
										<p>There is a greater risk for depression if the frontal lobe of your brain is less active.</p>
									<li>Medical conditions.</li> 
										<p>Certain conditions put you at a higher risk of depression, such as chronic illness, insomnia, chronic pain, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>

								<h3>How it affects their life</h3>
								<p>Their mental health may be negatively affected due to depression. For example, they may start to feel empty, lonely, sad , fatigued etc. Those diagnosed with depression usually have trouble with their memory and tend to be very indecisive. Not only can their mental health be affected, their physical body can too.</p>
								<p>For example, their weight fluctuates as depressive people start to overeat or lose their appetite, which can lead to obesity-related illnesses or nutritional deficiencies. Not only that, their blood vessels may start to constrict, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases or heart attacks. 
									Additionally, their pain sensitivity starts to increase, headaches and other types of pains occur more often as well. Medication usually does not make the cut. 
									Lastly, depression weakens their immune system and ability to fight off diseases and viruses. 
									This includes the common cold as well as more serious, long-term diseases like cardiovascular disease.</p>

							<h2 id="schizo">Schizophernia</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/art_ariel2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Schizophrenia is a <b>challenging brain disorder</b> that often makes it <b>difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal</b>, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. 
									It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world.</p>
								<h3>types</h3>
									<p>The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia or schizophrenia with paranoia as it’s often called. People with paranoid schizophrenia have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them or feel like they’re being constantly watched.</p>

									<p>Another type is childhood schizophrenia. A diagnosis of schizophrenia is common in people in their teens and early 20s. When symptoms occur before the age of 13, the condition is sometimes called early-onset or childhood schizophrenia.</p>
										
									<p>Diagnosing this condition is difficult. Behaviour changes aren’t unusual as children and teens develop. Plus, some of the most common symptoms of this mental health disorder also show up in other conditions. </p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/schizo_symptoms.png" alt="" /></span>
								<P>“Positive” symptoms of schizophrenia are behaviors that aren’t typical in otherwise healthy individuals whereas negative symptoms interrupt a person’s typical emotions, behaviors, and abilities
								</P>
								<h3>Causes</h3>
								<p>The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. Medical researchers believe several factors can contribute, including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Biological</li>
										<p>Recent studies have suggested that people with schizophrenia may show abnormalities in certain brain structures. Chemical abnormalities in the brain are believed to be responsible for many of the symptoms seen in schizophrenia. </p>
										<li>Genetic</li>
										<p>People with a family history of schizophrenia have a <b>higher risk</b> of developing this disorder.</p>
										<li>Environmental</li>
